This project was to develop a readme generator which would use Node.js to prompt the user to provide input to generate the readme. The readme will contain the following sections title, license badge (if necessary), description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests and questions. Use as much detail as necessary to create a professional readme for your projects.

## Installation

To install dependencies, in the integrated terminal run:
npm install

## Usage
To use this project, in the integrated terminal type in 
node index.js 

This will prompt you to answer the questions provided. It will then create a readme file from your input. The project will require you to provide a title, installation instructions, list of contributors/resources, Usage instructions, Tests with instructions, license, GitHub username and contact email. You can fill in the sections with as much detail necessary. When you submit all your input the readme, named readme.md, will be generated and stored within the Develop folder, separate from this projects readme.
